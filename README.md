## Overview

### Deliverable 1
#### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided non-random variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
* Vehicle Weight
* Spoiler Angle
* All Wheel Drive

Is the slope of linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
* The slope of this linear model is not considered to be zero. The p-value is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than assumed significance of 0.05% which indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
* This linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149 which is not high enough to be accurately predictive.
